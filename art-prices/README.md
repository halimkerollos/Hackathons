This was a contest I did on hackerearth where we were given a dataset of features 
and asked to create a machine learning model to predict the cost of art based on those features. Below is the link.

My code was written in Python using Jupyter Notebook and Conda environment.
A narration of my process and thinking is included in the notebook.
Enjoy.
